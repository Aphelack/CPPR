# Lab 1: Introduction to ASP.NET Core MVC

## Theory
In this lab, we learned about the basic structure of an ASP.NET Core MVC application. We explored how Controllers and Views interact.

### Key Concepts
- **Controller**: Handles incoming requests, processes them, and returns a response (usually a View).
- **View**: The user interface, typically a Razor view (.cshtml).
- **Routing**: How URLs are mapped to Controller actions.

## Implementation Details
- Created `HomeController`.
- Created `Index` view.
- Displayed "Hello World!".
- **Layout**: Created a shared layout `_Layout.cshtml` with a header (navbar), main content area, and footer.
- **Styling**: Used Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS in `site.css`.
- **Navigation**: Added a responsive navbar with dropdowns and social icons in the footer.
- **Content**: Added a form and an ordered list to the Index view.

## Tools Used
- VS Code
- .NET CLI
- Bootstrap 5
- jQuery
