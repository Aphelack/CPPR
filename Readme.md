# CPPR Project

## How to Run

This solution consists of two parts: the Backend API and the Frontend UI. Both need to be running for the application to work correctly.

### 1. Start the API
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd CPPR.API
dotnet run
```
The API will start on `http://localhost:5002`.

### 2. Start the UI
Open a **new** terminal (or split the current one) and run:
```bash
cd Project
dotnet run
```
The UI will start on `http://localhost:5197`.

## How to Restart
To restart a project:
1. Click inside the terminal window running the project.
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the application.
3. Run `dotnet run` again.
